    "description": "<p>Data is never truly neutral. It is imagined, created, managed, and archived through the perspectives, values, and lived experiences of those who produce it. This workshop introduces queer data care, a feminist framework that challenges conventional understandings of &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; research (Compton, 2018) and invites more ethical, accountable, and justice-oriented approaches to working with data. Together, we will explore how data practices are shaped by, and can reinforce, existing power structures. We will then examine alternative strategies for collecting, maintaining, and sharing data that center care, collaboration, and community.</p>\n\n<p>Guided by questions such as: How is data maintained? Who controls access? Who is most at-risk during data collection? And how can we collect data that more effectively serves marginalized communities while remaining attentive to the ways data collection can also heighten their vulnerability? &mdash;this workshop will guide participants through a reflection on and reimagining of data practices through case studies.</p>\n\n<p>In this workshop, we will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Analyze how social, political, and disciplinary contexts might shape data practices</li>\n\t<li>Identify how data practices can reinforce or resist structural power dynamics, particularly in relation to marginalized communities.</li>\n\t<li>Develop ethical, accountable, and community-centered approaches to data collection, maintenance, and access.</li>\n\t<li>Apply these methods and principles to your own research projects, and/or case studies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This workshop is for anyone interested in thinking differently about data, such as graduate students, librarians, community researchers, data professionals, and others engaged in research, advocacy, or knowledge production.

Podcasts are increasingly utilized to mobilize knowledge, enhance teaching, build academic communities, and collect research data. However, conventional conceptions of research impact continue to privilege traditionally peer-reviewed publications over this more flexible and dynamic form of scholarly activity.</p>\n\n<p>As movements like DORA (the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment) challenge these traditional paradigms, this panel will explore how podcasting can be more fully (and fairly) recognized within evolving frameworks of research assessment. Panelists will draw on their own podcasting initiatives, spanning community-based research series to pedagogical applications in the classroom, to consider podcasting not only as tool for traditional knowledge dissemination but as a method of scholarly and community-based knowledge production.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we will examine the methodological, pedagogical, and communicative possibilities of podcasting, and chart a course for broader recognition and celebration of the medium&rsquo;s impact within the field of research assessment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Catered Lunch:&nbsp;</strong>Join us for a catered lunch from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. immediately following the panel. Please indicate in your registration if you plan to attend the lunch so we can accommodate everyone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Karen Bird, Professor, Political Science, McMaster University</li>\n\t<li>Ruth Chen, Associate Dean, Continuing Professional Development and Associate Professor, School of Nursing, McMaster University</li>\n\t<li>Milica Hinic, Research and Engagement Coordinator, Wilson College of Leadership and Civic Engagement, McMaster University</li>\n\t<li>Joe Kim, Professor, Psychology, Neuroscience &amp; Behaviour, McMaster University</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Moderated by Jack Young, Research Impact and Bibliometrics Librarian, the Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship and McMaster University Libraries</p>\n\n<p><strong>Details:</strong>&nbsp;This event will be recorded and shared on the session&#39;s <a href=\"https://learn.scds.ca/events25-26/scholarly-podcasting.html\">information page</a>, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/\">Online Learning Catalogue.</a></p>"
