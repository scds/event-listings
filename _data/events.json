Join us for our roundtable <strong>November 27&nbsp;</strong><strong>from 11 AM - 12 PM on&nbsp;Connecting Research Impact c</strong>o-hosted with Research Impact and Bibliometrics Librarian Jack Young.</p>\n\n<p>Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are the backbone of a connected research ecosystem, enabling reliable discovery, reuse, and attribution for a variety of research objects. While PIDs, such as DOIs, are widely recognized for journal articles and datasets, their potential for non-traditional outputs (e.g. instruments, software/code, research projects, etc.) is only beginning to be realized.</p>\n\n<p>This panel brings together experts from across Canada to explore why PIDs matter for these emerging areas, how they support transparency and interoperability, and what practical steps institutions can take to implement them. Attendees will gain a clearer understanding of key PID systems like ORCID, DataCite, and RoR, and learn how expanding PID adoption can strengthen research visibility, accountability, and impact across disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>Around the table this month:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7055-4357\">John Aspler</a>,&nbsp;Manager, Canadian Persistent Identifier (PID) Community at the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5527-8489\">Mike Nason</a>,&nbsp;Open Scholarship &amp; Publishing Librarian at the University of New Brunswick and an Open Scholarly Infrastructure Advisor with the Public Knowledge Project</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2307-4590\">Thomas Guignard</a>, acting Persistent Identifiers (PID) Librarian at Universit&eacute; Laval</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://research.mcmaster.ca/office-of-the-vice-president-research-welcomes-new-director-research-platforms-support/\">Jamie Barnes</a>, Director, Research Platforms Support, McMaster Office of the Vice-President Research</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a1c5cab600046442e9ca22dbf61906391%40thread.tacv2/1755540378817?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22929fd809-7cb8-438c-93bc-f6bff66ea33a%22%7d\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Here is the meeting link</a>. <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A1c5cab600046442e9ca22dbf61906391%40thread.tacv2/Community%20of%20Practice?groupId=c265528b-ff67-44e6-a9c5-b36d5c2f27c6&amp;tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Learn more and join the RDM community</a>!</p>"

This workshop introduces queer data care, a feminist framework that challenges conventional understandings of &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; research (Compton, 2018) and invites more ethical, accountable, and justice-oriented approaches to working with data. Together, we will explore how data practices are shaped by, and can reinforce, existing power structures.

Who controls access? Who is most at-risk during data collection? And how can we collect data that more effectively serves marginalized communities while remaining attentive to the ways data collection can also heighten their vulnerability? &mdash;this workshop will guide participants through a reflection on and reimagining of data practices through case studies.</p>\n\n<p>In this workshop, we will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Analyze how social, political, and disciplinary contexts might shape data practices</li>\n\t<li>Identify how data practices can reinforce or resist structural power dynamics, particularly in relation to marginalized communities.</li>\n\t<li>Develop ethical, accountable, and community-centered approaches to data collection, maintenance, and access.</li>\n\t<li>Apply these methods and principles to your own research projects, and/or case studies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This workshop is for anyone interested in thinking differently about data, such as graduate students, librarians, community researchers, data professionals, and others engaged in research, advocacy, or knowledge production.

You&rsquo;ll learn from experts across digital scholarship, research data management, and data analysis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>How to Collect to Social Media Data:</strong> Digital Scholarship Librarian John Fink will demo manual collection and scraping tools like the Digital Methods Initiative&#39;s Zeeschuimer and 4CAT.</li>\n\t<li><strong>How to Analyze Social Media Data:</strong> Data Analysis and Visualization Librarian Subhanya Sivajothy will intro how to comb through social media data and show patterns.</li>\n\t<li><strong>How to Manage Social Media Data: </strong>Research Data Management Specialist Danica Evering will share tools and best practices for wrangling and organizing social media data.</li>\n\t<li><strong>How to Navigate Social Media Data Ethics:</strong> Digital Scholarship Coordinator Alexis-Carlota Cochrane will explore ethical considerations for researching social media, including strategies for protecting privacy and minimizing harm throughout the research and publication process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Collect social media data using both manual and automated scraping tools like Zeeschuimer and 4CAT.</li>\n\t<li>Analyze datasets to identify key trends and insights with introductory data exploration techniques.</li>\n\t<li>Organize and manage social media data effectively by applying recommended best practices and tools.</li>\n\t<li>Understand and address ethical challenges in social media research, including protecting privacy and minimizing harm at all stages.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This session is ideal for researchers, students, and practitioners across disciplines who are curious about using social media data in their work and want to approach it thoughtfully, ethically, and responsibly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Details:</strong>&nbsp;Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its <a href=\"https://learn.scds.ca/dmds25-26/social-media.html\">information page</a>.&nbsp;This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/\">Online Learning Catalogue.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Facilitator Bio:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Alexis-Carlota Cochrane (she/they) is the Digital Scholarship Coordinator at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scds.ca/\">Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship</a>.
